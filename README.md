#Miami University/BCRTA Bus Tracking Application
Created a Ruby on Rails based application that housed the RESTful API for and acted as the back-end for a live bus tracking mobile application for Miami University and the Butler County Regional Transit Authority. The application kept track of several different buses, their routes, stops, as well as administrative information such as mileages and number of riders on the buses of varying types and the money collected for those riders. The RESTful API allowed the mobile applications created to make calls to the database on the back-end to find out where the buses were. It was also used for the tablet applications used by the bus drivers to manage the above information as well as to receive the buses position. I was personally responsible for the creation of the application besides scaffolding a few models of the Rails application.
